### Hello there üëã

I'm currently a member of the OS team at Hugging Face ü§ó, working mainly with text generation and TensorFlow.
I have a PhD in ML applied to 5G signals üì°, and I've applied ML to several modalities and industries.

Here are a few interesting projects and publications, by industry:

ü§ñ Machine Learning
1. Hugging Face ü§ó - TBD ;)

üèó Construction
1. [nPlan](https://www.nplan.io/)
  1.1. Modeled constructions projects as graphs, and explored node-level predictions;
  1.2. Forecasted delays modeled as a classification problem, enabling the learning of arbitrary delay distributions for each input ([paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-08223-8_9));
  1.3. Explored aleatoric vs epistemic uncertainty estimation with [Monte Carlo Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142v6) and ensembles ([some code](https://github.com/nitbix/toupee)).

üì° Telecommunications
1. [Square Kilometer Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Kilometre_Array)
  1.1. Accelerated FIR filters using OpenCL, on FPGAs ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7828456/), [code](https://github.com/gante/OpenCL-FPGA-FIR-Filter));
2. Positioning (PhD)
  2.1. Designed a new signal that can be collected from 5G communications, containing spatial information about the surroundings ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8690987));
  2.2. ML (DNNs, CNNs, LSTMs, and [TCNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01271)) can then be used to convert that signal in 2.1. into the receiver's position, while being as accurate, but much more energy efficient, than the GPS ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9080126), [code](https://github.com/gante/mmWave-localization-learning));
  2.3 Used [Monte Carlo Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142v6) to estimate the uncertainty of the position predictions from 2.2. ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9626568), [code](https://github.com/gante/mmWave-localization-learning)).
